## About

**Single Atom Catalysis**

- **What is SAC? -** Single atom catalysis is a process in which a single atom present on the surface of a material drives the catalytic reaction. Such a material with single atom is called as single atom catalyst. Single atom spread over on a surface will mean individualised catalytically active sites that can individually drive the catalytic process.
- **It's history -** The concept was emerging in 2011 when a research study demonstrated that atomically dispersed platinum atoms on Iron oxide was effective than using platinum nanoparticles, for the catalytic process. And it has rapidly grown since then, owing to its maximum atomic utilization efficiency, tailorable cataltic activity and superior site selectivity.
- **How it might transform things in future? -** The research so far suggests that promising advancements are being seen in the energy, sustainable chemistry and biomedical sectors. With its unique superiorities like size, tailorobility and precise functionalization, it is expected to revolutionalize the energy and biomedical sectors in the coming decades.
